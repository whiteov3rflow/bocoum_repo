# Terminal Adventure Game

Create a terminal_game.py that walks the player through a captivating mini-game adventure! In each step of the adventure, the player should be presented with 2 or more options on where to go next.

Be as creative as you want with this, but make sure your code runs!

Some ideas include:

    A space-based adventure of a crew of curious individuals exploring an unknown galaxy.
    A “Day in the Life” story that walks you through choices the main character makes based on conditions like the time of day, the actions that the player take, etc.
    A classic mini-RPG (role-playing game) with hp health points, character moves like attack/block/heal, and NPCs (non-player characters) that attacks based on a random number generator.
